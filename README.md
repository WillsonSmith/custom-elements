I'm bringing this back from the dead.

## What is this?

This is a collection of tested web components that solve problems of varying sizes. Every component in this repo was designed to solve a problem I faced.

### Usage

```sh
 npm i @willson/components
```

```js
// index.js
import '@willson/components/file-drop.js';
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!doctype html>
<html>
  ...

  <body>
    <file-drop></file-drop>

    <script type="module">
      import 'index.js';
      // or whatever inclusion method you perfer
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### What is components/legacy?

That's beyond our borders. You must never go there.
